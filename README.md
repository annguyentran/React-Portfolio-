# React Portfolio Website

This is a Portfolio that uses the React library to make the user interface. The user will first be presented with a header and a Footer with the creator's github link. The user is able to navigate to 4 different sections which are "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume" sections. The" About Me" page is the default page the user starts off at and the section is highlighted depending on the page the user is currently on. The "About Me" section is about the creator of the website. The "Portfolio" section are the projects that the creator has done with simple descriptions of what they are and the user can click on the picture icon to navigate to that project and test them. The "Contact" section is where users can type in the information and question for the creator. The "Resume" section is where the user can download the resume and see the different skills that the creator has.
